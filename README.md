## Project setup

### MySQL
To use the API database you need to setup the database manually via MySQL workbench and a MySQL connection. Without this connection, the API cannot create, read, update or delete any data. Check the *application.yaml* file to see what details you should use for the setup. These details can be changed to your liking. 

### Localhost
The API is hosted on the localhost address of your own machine. You can change the port in the *application.yaml* file if needed. 

### Modification
You can modify the variables such a names, id's etc. to your liking. Make sure to do this in a structured and safe way to avoid any errors when running the project after modification. It is also possible to add additional methods to expand the possibilities of the API. 

### Dependencies
Make sure to check the dependencies in the *pom.xml* file to check for any errors before running the project. Any misconfigurations can cause failure to the API.
